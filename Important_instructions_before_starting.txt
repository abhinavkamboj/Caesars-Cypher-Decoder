Goals we need to achieve:
1. Create two seperate programs. 

One that decodes the Caesar's cypher(Done by me) and the other which converts the simple text to Caesar's Cypher(To be done by you).
Instructions for your program- 1)Take two inputs: a key i.e int type and a string that is the simple message to be converted to caesar's cypher.
2) Use only capital alphabets. Use exception handling for the input of wrong data types.
3)Avoid using random names for variables to make the code more readable.

Note: Deadline to complete Goal 1 is next sunday i.e 26/08/18. Next goal will be updated after that.

Thank You!!
